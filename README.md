# CGlinka Designs

This is a personal website portfolio that I made from scratch using React components and custom CSS styling. It was largely inspired by EGATOR at EGATOR tutorials, though I have made it as much of my owne as possible and will continue to customize it to my owne preferences. If you are reading this and interested, I highly recommend checking him out and doing some code alongs with him. He is very informative and just a hugely talented individual when it comes to creating stylish and modern looking UI/UX websites.
